## finding best h5 file

get overlap of two extents
```{r get-overlap, eval=FALSE}
overlap <- intersect(temp_ext, h5Extent)

```

check if overlap is the same as temp

```{r check-if-overlap, eval=FALSE}
if (temp_ext == overlap) {
  recordRaster[i] <- afile
  i <- i+1
} 
```

return remaining file
```{r return, eval=FALSE}
# only one file left
if (length(recordRaster) == 1) {
  returnFile <- recordRaster
  break
}

```
