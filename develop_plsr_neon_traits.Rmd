# Goal  

Use PLS regression to relate foliar nitrogen (plot level kg/ha) to remote sensing data.

## PLSR model

Decided to use the `PLS` package because it was cited in this paper: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/13-2110.1/full

```{r LOAD PACKAGES}

library(pls)

# load sample data

data("gasoline")

```


```{r TRAIN-TEST-GROUPS}

dTrain <- gasoline[1:50,]
dTest <- gasoline[51:60,]

```

```{r PLS-MODEL}

m1 <- plsr(octane ~ NIR, ncomp = 10, data = dTrain, validation = "LOO")

summary(m1)

```
